## Introduction
This project is designed to evaluate the time consumption of algorithms **RC6**, **AES**, and **DES** for _Encryption_ and _Decryption_ and when they are used with the ***Blockchain technology***. 

While running the code, user can use two methods :

1. Directly run `main.py` file which will run and display all the time consumption for every algorithm with defualt input string and default key.
2. User can run each algorithm individually and give input string and key and evaluate the result.

While running the code, if user does not give an input of desired length, padding will be done as per the requirement.
After padding, encryption will be done.
After encryption, encrypted data will be treated as input for blockchain and it will be stored in blockchain.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/AmritaCSN/Data-Security-Approach-Using-Blockchain-Mechanism-and-Cryptography-Algorithms_Navdeep.git`
2. Naviagte to the directory using : `cd Data-Security-Approach-Using-Blockchain-Mechanism-and-Cryptography-Algorithms_Navdeep`
3. The source codes are in `src` directory so we naviagate to it using `cd src`
4. Now the user can execute commands as explained in [Introduction](#Introduction)
