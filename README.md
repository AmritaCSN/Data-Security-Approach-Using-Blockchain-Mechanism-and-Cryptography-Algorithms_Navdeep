This project is designed to evaluate the time consumption of algorithms RC6, AES and DES for encryption, Decryption and when it is used with the blockchain technology. While running the code, user can use two methods
1: directly run main.py file which will run and display all the time consumption for every algorithm with defualt input string and default key.
2: User can run each algorithm one by one and give input string and key and evaluate the result.

While running the code, if user does not give an input of desired length, padding will be done as per the requirement.
After padding, encryption will be done.
After encryption, encrypted data will be treated as input for blockchain and it will be stored in blockchain.
